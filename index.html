    <p>Hey, my name is Shaan Patel.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-break">I’m a Bay Area native (born and raised) and graduated from
        <a href="https://www.bcp.org/" target="_blank">Bellarmine College Prep</a> in San Jose, CA.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-break">From there, I headed off to the midwest to attend  
            <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue</a> in West Lafayette, Indiana, where I studied finance and learned what a  
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilermaker" target="_blank">boilermaker</a> is. During my sophomore summer, I did an internship at a venture studio called  
            <a href="https://www.fountane.com/" target="_blank">Fountane</a>, helping pre-seed startups refine their strategy and raise funding.</p>
        

    <p class="paragraph-break">After seeing others thrive in that ecosystem, about six months later, I got my first taste of entrepreneurship when I built 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dp-sports-software/?viewAsMember=true" target="_blank">DP Sports</a>, consumer betting software that identified Positive Expected Value (+EV) bets by pinning Daily Fantasy Sports apps like PrizePicks & Underdog Fantasy against traditional player prop markets like DraftKings and Fanduel.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-break">Outside of work, my hobbies come and go. Lately, I’ve gotten back into reading, strategy games like Clash Royale, watching NBA basketball, cooking, and even trying to make my first iOS app (never left the Figma stage). In the past, I’ve enjoyed playing the   
        <a href="https://youtu.be/po4ELLwF_sI?feature=shared" target="_blank">drums</a> and creating graphic design.</p>
        

    <p class="paragraph-break">But now, I’m finally back exploring opportunities in venture—both on the operating and investing side, hoping to soon figure out what’s next.</p>
